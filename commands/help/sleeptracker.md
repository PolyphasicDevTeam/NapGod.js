Most products claiming to track your sleep are not accurate, since they are based only on body movement. This includes most fitness trackers and apps. Generally, anything that's not on your head won't be able to produce a reliable result. 

Sleeptrackers that the users here are experienced with are the Olimex openEEG (+-200$); and the Zeo. 
The Olimex is a semi-DIY solution that produces great results; the Zeo is an out-of the box solution but only available secondhand. Expect to pay 60-100$ for a Zeo. The Zeo is less accurate than the Olimex.
Other head-mounted solutions may or may not provide the right results; when in doubt, ask in #sleep_tech for more information!


Some research about the accuracy of "sleeptrackers":

***Abstract (1):*** ..Reviewed : BodyMedia FIT, Fitbit Flex, Jawbone UP, Basis Band, Innovative Sleep Solutions SleepTracker, and Zeo Sleep Manager Pro.  The review identified a critical lack of basic information about the devices: five out of six devices provided no supporting information on their sensor accuracy and four out of six devices provided no information on their output metrics accuracy. Peer reviewed articles wake detection accuracy was revealed to be quite low and to vary widely (BodyMedia, 49.9±3.6%; Fitbit, 19.8%; Zeo, 78.9% to 83.5%). 
***Abstract (2):*** The growing literature comparing these devices against polysomnography/actigraphy shows that they tend to underestimate sleep disruptions and overestimate total sleep times and sleep efficiency in normal subjects.
***Conclusions (3):*** Our study shows that the absolute parameters and sleep staging reported by the Sleep Time app (Azumio, Inc.) for iPhones correlate poorly with polysomnography.
