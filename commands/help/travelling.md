Being on a polyphasic schedule while also travelling is difficult, but possible. If time zones are switched there are 3 recommend options: 

**1.** Sick with the original schedule.
**2.** Rotate the schedule to fit the new timezone. 
**3.** Return to monophasic sleep for the duration of the trip.

The optimal route is to stick with the original schedule during the travel, but depending on the duration of the stay rotating the schedule should also be possible. Note that rotating the schedule will cause adaptation to be set back. During adaptation it’s important to stick to all sleeping times, which is why many delay their adaptation until after they’ve travelled.

Jetlag occurs when you travel through different time zones. If you decide to change your schedule during the stay you will likely initially struggle to fall asleep fast in the new time zone, and your schedule may become a mess. Depending on how long your trip is, how long you stay in the new region, and how long you have been polyphasic, the travel can be difficult or relatively easy to handle.

Tips for optimal polyphasic travelling:

**1.** Plan the trip so your core aligns with the flight if possible.

**2.** Try not to core in the airports, as you will be vulnerable to thefts, personal safety, etc.

**3.** If you're adapted, you can flex the naps if possible. Skipping will also be more manageable, and small oversleeps tolerable.

**4.** If you haven't started your schedule yet, waiting until after you travel is often the best option.
