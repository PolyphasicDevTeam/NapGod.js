**Eyestrain:**
If you have problems with eye strain during screen use, it is suggested that you take regular breaks and switch to paper media for reading, and to look at somethinig farther away for 20s to allow your eyes to relax. Also for a period of 6-12h (preferably 8-10), beginning 2h prior to the first cor, you should avoid light (especially blue light). Red light is the least harmful, and does not have to be avoided (but high levels of red light are still undesirable). Do this by using programs such as F.lux on your computer, by having red light in your house, or by wearing red-tinted glasses. See `!darkperiod` for more information.
