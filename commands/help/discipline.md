When adapting to a schedule, make sure to stick precicely to ALL sleep times in your schedule for the first month. Go to bed at the same time every day without exception. Even if you don't fall asleep fast at first, keep sticking with your scheduled sleep times, and eventually you will fall asleep asleep quickly when sleep times come. Avoid oversleeping at all costs during adaptation. Small mess-ups should still be tolerable and you can still adapt after around one-two months. See `!alarms` for advice for avoiding oversleeps.
