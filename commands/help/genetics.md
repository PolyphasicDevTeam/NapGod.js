Some people have specific genetic mutations that allow them to function at optimal levels with much less sleep than the average person. Most people need 7-8h of sleep per day on monophasic schedules to be fully functional, but some people need less than 6h of total sleep each day. A common gene which affects the general sleep requirement is the DEC2 gene. Their sleep compression is often much higher than most people, enabling them to attempt schedules like Bimaxion, Trimaxion, SPAMAYL (and in rare cases even Dymaxion or Uberman), with a higher possibility to succeed long term than most. If you have lower sleep requirements, you would likely know that by the time you're an adult. Therefore, think twice before attempting these extreme schedules, as they may have negative health effects in the long term.
