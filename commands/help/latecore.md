Having a late core is possible in theory, but it's going to be hard to maintain practically. If the core doesn't start between 20:00-24:00 (21:00-23:00 for DC schedules), optimal circadian management is going to be required (see `!circadian`). The less sleeping time the core has, the harder having a late core is going to be. 

It's easier to pull off a late core if the bedtime doesn't change after starting adaptation. If there's a big switch in the time when the core starts, the risk of getting an SWS rebound increases a lot, even for schedules with over 2 cycles in the core.
