QC0 (Quad Core 0)
-----------------------------------------------
*This schedule is* ***experimental*** *and* ***not well tested***, *with the specifics still being under debate and scrutiny.  It is* ***strongly recommended*** *that inexperienced polyphasers do* ***NOT*** *attempt this schedule and instead stick to something better tested (such as Triphasic/Triphasic-extended).*

**Invented by**: GeneralNguyen
**Alternatively known as**: Quadphasic, Four Core 0 (FC0), Quad Core, 4C0
**Total sleep**: 6 hours
**Classification**: Quad Core schedule
**Specification**: 4 cores of 1-cycle length
**Mechanism**: One core sleep before or around midnight, one around dawn, and one around noon. Similar to Dual Core sleep, 2 cores placed around SWS & REM peaks contain higher amounts of SWS and REM respectively. Long siesta and another core in graveyard hours to balance out the schedule and give mixed sleep stages. However, it is also possible to schedule a core in later evening hours (e.g, 23:00) thanks to decently high total sleep. It is also possible to have 4 equidistant core sleeps, resembling Dymaxion structure.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Hard
**Ideal scheduling**: One core sleep around or before midnight, the next 2 cores are ~2.5-3h apart from each other and the last core is in early/mid afternoon with a longer wake gap.
