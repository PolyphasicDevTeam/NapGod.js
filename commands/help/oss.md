OSS stands for "OverSleeping Syndrome." This applies to those who keep consistently oversleeping while adapting to a sleep schedule, but keep continuing and expecting to adapt eventually. The syndrome is also fatal for adaptation, because:

**1.** Continuing to oversleep while trying to adapt will mess up one's circadian rhythm and sleep compression entirely. The body is trying to adjust to a certain sleep cycle length, but this can only happen with **no** oversleeping.

**2.** As sleep is not stabilized (oversleeping during intended waking time), the person will fail to adapt to a schedule and thus will constantly be plagued in sleep deprivation. Long-term sleep deprivation leads to obesity, diabetes, increased heart rate, headaches, fatigue, frequent anger and more negative symptoms.

The solution to this syndrome is generally to go back to monophasic sleep or another non-reducing schedule for at least 1-2 weeks to regain homeostasis, then attempt to adapt to a polyphasic schedule again. This is called "recovery" (see `!recovery`).
