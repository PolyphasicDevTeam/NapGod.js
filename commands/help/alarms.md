**1.** Have multiple devices with multiple alarms go off at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20m after wake. Have the first alarm be some upbeat music that makes sure you wake up with the feeling of being able to do anything! 

**2.** Make smart use of barcode alarms; for example you could place a code in the fridge (pushing you to drink a glass of cold water),or in the shower. 

**3.** Turn off the alarms after they each go off, don't turn them off all at once. 

**4.** It's imperative to use more than one device, since if that device fails you likely won't wake up. 

**5.** Keep each alarm device away from your bed so that you are required to get out of bed to turn it off.

Popular app options for alarms are "Alarmy", and "Can't wake up". Ask about what different people use in #sleep_tech if you want something special. If you have a person that could wake you, make a backup alarm that's loud enough for them to hear, and make sure they know to wake you no matter what.
