Bimaxion (Bimaxion)
-----------------------------------------------
*This schedule is intended for people attempting to transition to Dymaxion or retain a Dymaxion sleep rhythm. People looking for a permanent schedule should consider DC3 or E3 instead.*
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: generalNguyen
**Alternatively known as**: Bimax, Quad, Quadphasic
**Total sleep**: 4 hours
**Classification**: Dymaxion transitional schedule in a Dual Core style
**Specification**: 2 core sleeps of minimum length, 2 naps
**Mechanism**: One core sleep before midnight, one around dawn, Dymaxion noon nap, and Dymaxion afternoon nap. Sleep stage division: Dusk core SWS, dawn core REM. Late nap can contain mixed sleep stages. More flexible than Dymaxion because there are 2 core sleeps to gain SWS and so 2 naps can be moved around to some extent.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Hard
**Ideal scheduling**: The whole schedule's sleep distribution looks like Dymaxion, with one core before midnight, one core around dawn, one noon nap, one afternoon/evening nap.
