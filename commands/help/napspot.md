Try to avoid sleeping in bed since it increases the risk of oversleeping. Sleeping on a flat surface (with carpet) is recommended for spine health, waking on time, and other health benefits. It's possible to train yourself to sleep while sitting in a chair or car, or laying on an uncomfortable surface. Stick with it and you'll fall asleep eventually!
