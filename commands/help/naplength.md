30 minute naps are notoriously difficult to wake up from because you enter SWS around 25 minutes in on average, and SWS can cause bad sleep inertia, zombie mode (a lack of awareness upon waking that causes you to turn off your alarms without fully waking up, and then go back to sleep), or worse, simply sleeping through your alarm in some extreme cases. It's also unhealthy to interrupt SWS. For these reasons, we usually recommend 20m over 30m for naps.

Don't allow yourself more than 2m to fall asleep (ideally, stick with 20m total nap time). Once sleep deprivation starts to kick in, you will fall asleep within minutes, and if your naps are any longer you risk entering SWS. If you want to sleep longer, try aiming for a full cycle of 90m.

If you don't have the ability to take 20m naps then two 15m naps could replace one 20m. Keep all naps the same length.
