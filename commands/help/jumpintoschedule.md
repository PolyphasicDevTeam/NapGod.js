**Before you start your schedule, you should get used to the future bedtime before starting, to minimize the amount of initial sleep deprivation you build up from the first night.**

For example, you want to do mono->E1, but your current bedtime deviates from the one you want to have on E1:
`Current mono bedtime:` 24:00
`Desired E1 bedtime:` 23:00

Jumping into the schedule right away would most likely lead to you not being able to fall asleep for at least an hour, so you would right away start with a lot more sleep deprivation. This will make oversleeping later in adaptation more likely.


If you have troubles shifting back your bedtime, you can try a few things to aid this process:
**1.** Apply a proper dark period about 2-3hrs prior your bedtime. This is a good practice for beginning any polyphasic schedule.
**2.** Shift by small amounts each day by ~30m intervals.
**3.** Take your time with it and do it gradually, laying in bed for hours straight without sleeping won't help you.
