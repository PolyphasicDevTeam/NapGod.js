**Everyman:**
The Everyman (E) line has a single core and naps during the day. The premise of this schedule line is that 90m chunks of the core are traded for an equivalent number of 20m naps during the day.

The core of the E schedules can be scheduled slightly later than the DC ones, since the core should contain both SWS and REM. 
*A core that is scheduled too late will not allow you to achieve sufficient SWS.*

After adaptation the naps of E1 and E2 can be quite flexible; in order to gain some flexibility with E3 the core should be extended to 3.5h. **DO NOT** flex at all during adaptation.
E4 and E5 are below the minimum sleep threshold, and should generally be avoided.
