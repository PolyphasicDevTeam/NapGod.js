Avoid any drug that alters your sleep either directly (by altering sleep stages/cycle lengths, making you sleepier/more alert, etc) or indirectly (by making you you lose control or motivation in some way). This is especially important during adaptation. Check in #fitness_and_nutrition or read some studies if you're unsure about a certain drug.
