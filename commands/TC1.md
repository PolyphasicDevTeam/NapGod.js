TC1 (Tri Core 1)
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: generalNguyen
**Total sleep**: 4 hours 50 minutes
**Classification**: Tri Core schedule
**Specification**: 3 core sleeps of minimum length, 1 nap
**Mechanism**: Sleep stage division: 1 SWS core, 2 REM core and 1 REM nap. 3-hour rhythm to line up with sleep-wake cycle length of each core sleep. Predicted to be more flexible than Dual Core sleep schedules because the core component of Tri Core consists of 3 cores to be shifted quite comfortably once adapted. 
**Adaptation difficulty**: Moderate
**Ideal scheduling**: 3 core sleeps are concentrated during the night to boost alertness for the whole day, so only one small nap in the afternoon is needed. 3-hour rhythm among each core sleep is recommended. Distance of wake time among each core sleep could be shortened if possible, but should not be less than 2 hours. Such a schedule will include a dusk core, night core, and dawn core.
