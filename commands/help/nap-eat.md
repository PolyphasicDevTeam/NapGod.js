Digestion activates your nervous system which increases sleep onset times, and prevents or limits your body from entering the deeper vital stages of sleep.

It is best to eat meals at least 2-3h before a nap (to allow time for digestion before sleep), or after a nap. Some light snacks such as fruit are okay within 1-2h before nap.
