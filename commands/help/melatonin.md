Melatonin is useful for setting core bedtime earlier or later than it has been, just like its common use for jetlag. This is especially useful for setting your circadian rhythm on the first 1-4 days of your new schedule.
For polyphasic schedules, it's recommended NOT to use extended time-release melatonin, as those are designed for mono-length sleeps (~8h). Typically only take for a few nights at a time. The optimal amount of melatonin will vary per person. Toxicity of melatonin is known to be extremely low, but common doses range from 1-5mg, and 10mg in rare cases.
