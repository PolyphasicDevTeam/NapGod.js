Recovery is the concept of sleeping with natural wakes until all sleep deprivation is gone. This usually takes about 1-2 weeks, but it can take more or less time depending on the amount of sleep deprivation accumulated. While doing recovery one should have a consistent start time for your sleep(s).

Recovery is usually done:
**1.** Before doing a polyphasic sleep schedule, if one is sleep deprived.
**2.** After falling into OSS (see `!OSS`).
**3.** After an oversleep big enough that you know you won't be able to continue.

Mono-recovery (one core) is the prefered recovering schedule, but it's also possible to recover on biphasic schedules (will likely take longer due to the alleviated sleep deprivation during the day):
**E1-recovery:** One 20m nap during the day and a core in the night without an alarm.
**Siesta-recovery:** One 90m core during the day and a core in the night without an alarm.
**Segmented-recovery:** One 3.5h core, followed by a break and another core without an alarm.

Recovering from a polyphasic schedule often follows this pattern:
A few days with a short core (due to the body remembering to wake up early) 
-> many days with a long core
-> 2-3 days of core times of the usual length.

You are likely done recovering when the sleep has stabilized at a set length that's of similar length to before attempting polyphasic sleep, around 6-8h for most adults.

If recovery with natural wakes is impossible due to scheduling limitations, you can recover simply by attempting to get as much sleep as you can get, but recovery will take longer.
