**Underage**
Underage people- especially those under 16- should avoid reducing their total sleep entirely. Those over 16 are strongly recommended to do one of the following schedules, since both their brain and body are still developing, and cutting light sleep could have effects that are detrimental for the body in the future: 

**1.** E1 (6h20m)
**2.** Siesta (6h30, even Siesta-extended is plausable with 7.5h sleep)
**3.** Segmented (7h).

Siesta is good if you have no previous napping experience, since it has a full sleep cycle during the day. It's very easy to adapt to sleeping a full cycle, since both rem and sws could easily be inserted into it. Siesta has a 5h core in the night, and a 1.5h core in the day. Siesta-extended is even more favorable for underaged people, since it gives the recommened 7h30m of sleep. Siesta-extended has a 6h night core (4 cycles), and a 1.5h day core (1 cycle). 

E1 is a strange one. It has the possibility to be too easy, and you could have to wait several weeks to be able to sleep for the nap, since so little sleep is actually cut (for underaged people more sleep is actually cut, so it might still be relativly easy to learn to fall asleep for the nap). If you go for E1 without previous napping experience and you fail to fall asleep for the naps within a reasonable timeframe see `!fallasleep`. 

Segmented is a bit harder, but still generally easy. It's better to do segmented if you normally wake up during the night. Otherwise, the quality of the sleep should be the same as the other options.

Each of these options operate on different mechanics. Siesta takes advantage of the statistically likely REM period that happens at the 4.5-5h mark, and adds a cycle in the day. E1 trades a full cycle of light sleep and REM for a REM-filled nap, while segmented removes a cycle but makes the cycles longer to compensate.

You can look at each of them in #botspam with the commands `+siesta`, `+segmented`, and `+e1`.
