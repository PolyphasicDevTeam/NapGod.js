**Falling asleep:**
Try to lower your body temperature to fall asleep more easily. Create a sleep-inducing environment by lowering the light level in the room, remain calm, and try focusing on your breath. Inhale and exhale at regular intervals.
Try to avoid getting caught in stimulating trains of thought, and perhaps try reading something entertaining before bed. Have a hot shower around 1h before sleep time. Listen to lulling music, brown/white noise or ASMR. Stay away from electronics (esp. screens) at least 15m before bedtime.
Remaining calm is essential for falling asleep, so it is most helpful to accept that you may not fall asleep quickly (or at all for naps at first), and enjoy the relaxing, meditative personal time. Remember that laying down and attempting to sleep will help the body learn when it's time to sleep, causing you to fall asleep faster in the future. In addition, simply laying down and resting provides a wakefulness boost, albeit smaller than if you fall asleep. Don't get discouraged, and keep trying.

If you fail to fall asleep even after a long time on the schedulem, spending some time on a harder schedule like Naptation, E3, etc. until you fall asleep reliably can be helpful. The ability to nap is a skill that has been anecdotally proven to stick even after going back to mono sleep for a long time, so recovering after learning to fall asleep is recommended.
