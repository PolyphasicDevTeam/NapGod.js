Trimaxion (Trimaxion)
-----------------------------------------------
*This schedule is intended for people attempting to transition to Dymaxion or retain a Dymaxion sleep rhythm. People looking for a permanent schedule should consider E4 instead. It is also* ***below the minimum sleep threshold of most people*** *and consequently has a* ***very low success rate***.  *It is* ***strongly recommended*** *that inexperienced polyphasers do* ***NOT*** *attempt this schedule.*
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: generalNguyen
**Total sleep**: 3 hours
**Classification**: Dymaxion transitional schedule in an Everyman style
**Specification**: 1 core sleep of minimum length (one full cycle), 3 Dymaxion naps
**Mechanism**: 4 sleeps per day. Core sleep before midnight for most SWS, naps for REM/mixed stages. Circadian spots include: Core sleep around dusk, dawn nap, noon nap, and evening nap. Mixed-stage nap(s) in all 3 naps, or possibly pure-REM or pure-SWS nap. More flexible than Dymaxion because of having a core sleep, so after adaptation 3 naps can be moved around when convenient.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Very hard
**Ideal scheduling**: Distribution of sleep resembles Dymaxion. Transition step to Dymaxion and also as a fallback from Dymaxion should adaptation fail.
