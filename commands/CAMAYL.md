CAMAYL (Core As Much As You Like)
-----------------------------------------------
*This schedule is* ***experimental*** *and* ***not well tested***, *with the specifics still being under debate and scrutiny.  It is* ***strongly recommended*** *that inexperienced polyphasers do* ***NOT*** *attempt this schedule and instead stick to something better tested (SEVAMAYL).*
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: generalNguyen
**Total sleep**: Undefined, but may average around 6 hours (usually 4 cores)
**Classification**: Flexible schedule with variable number of core sleeps
**Specification**: Multiple core sleeps of 90m in length
**Mechanism**: Variant of SPAMAYL that includes all core sleeps. Evolves well from adaptation to QC0, then QC0-flex as a helpful intermediate. The core sleeps provide more SWS than REM or vice versa depending on which hours they are placed in the day. Under emergency situations where an extended wake gap is required, a short power nap (10-15m) can be added to sustain wakefulness until the next core sleep. Strong reliance on the ability to detect when the need to rest is, to get quality core sleeps.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Hard
**Ideal scheduling**: 3-4 core sleeps on average from day to day, with 1-2 core sleeps around graveyard hours. Core spacing and placement should take into account natural periods of tiredness. In the afternoon 6+ hour wake gaps are common,  whereas alertness may wane after 2-4 hours awake in the morning. One core sleep at night may be extended by 90m after adapted when one core has to be skipped or after a long extended wake period.
