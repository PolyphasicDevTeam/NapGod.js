--- Nap God help ---

Nap God can be used to look up information about common sleep schedules, change your displayed sleep schedule and group, and to save and look up napcharts.
-----------------------------------------------
**Schedule List**
To view information about a sleep schedule, type `+` followed by the schedule name. For example, `+DC1` will display information about DC1.

Non-polyphasic schedules: Mono
Biphasic schedules: `E1` `Segmented` `Siesta`
Everyman schedules: `E2` `E3` `E4` `E5` `Trimaxion`
Dual core schedules: `Bimaxion` `DC1` `DC2` `DC3` `DC4`
Tri core schedules: `TC1` `TC2` `Triphasic`
Experimental/Unproven schedules: `SEVAMAYL`
Nap only schedules: `Dymaxion` `Naptation` `SPAMAYL` `Tesla` `Uberman`

Once you have chosen your sleep schedule you can use the `+set` command to tag yourself with it and move yourself to the matching role. You can also use `+set` to set a napchart against your account (created on <https://napchart.com/> or with the `+create` command) which others can then look at. Further details found below.

If you are new to polyphasic sleeping and are not sure about which sleep schedule to try, feel free to ask for help and advice in the #beginners channel.
