Biphasic-X (Bi-X)
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: generalNguyen
**Alternatively known as**: Prototype X, Experimental X, Bi-X
**Total sleep**: 7-9 hours (equivalent to monophasic baseline)
**Classification**: Flexible, Biphasic, Non-reducing Polyphasic Sleep
**Specification**: 1 long core sleep, naps with varying lengths or consistent length depending on days, NREM1/NREM2 nap if duration is short (< ~25-30m), contains SWS/REM if duration is longer (> 60m)
**Mechanism**: 1 core sleep, 1 nap as main form. More than 1 core sleep or 1 nap (reduce total sleep) is allowed on busier days. Recovery day is done afterwards to recover from sleep deprivation (increase total sleep by extending either core length or nap length in Biphasic form) to keep up napping habits. Both core sleep and nap(s) are flexible and can be moved around to a degree to ensure circadian rhythm is preserved.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Easy
**Ideal scheduling**: Consistent dark period everyday, core sleep starts 1-2 hours after dark period. Nap during daytime, no later than 6 PM.
