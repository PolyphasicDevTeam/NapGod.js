SPAMAYL (Sleep Polyphasically As Much As You Like)
-----------------------------------------------
This schedule is below the minimum sleep threshold of most people and consequently has a very low success rate.  It is strongly recommended that inexperienced polyphasers do NOT attempt this schedule.
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: Rasmus- 
**Total sleep**: Undefined, but on average 2.5 hours (7-8 20-min naps per day)
**Classification**: Flexi schedule in a nap-only style- 
**Specification**: Multiple short naps- 
**Mechanism**: No rhythm, no BRAC concepts, there usually have to have more than 6 20-minute naps per day average. Stocking up sleep in a day then having few or even no naps the next day is also possible. Strong reliance on the ability to detect when the need to rest is, to get quality REM naps. At least 1 SWS nap, and some other naps can be mixed-stages nap. SPAMAYL can be stabilized and formed into a rhythm if one has a stable work/schedule everyday (set nap times, like 2-hour rhythm, napping once every 1.7 hours at night for example).
**Adaptation difficulty**: Insanely hard- 
**Ideal scheduling**: Most naps should be spread during graveyard hours to avoid the need to nap during the day with work, social life, etc
