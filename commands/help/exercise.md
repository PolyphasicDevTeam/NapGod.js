**Exercise:**
People who do a lot of intense muscle building (HIIT, lifting, etc) need at least 3 sleep cycles in their core (first core for DC) to handle the increased SWS need. Cardio doesn't increase the SWS need significantly.

Most people should have at least 2h after exercising before sleeping in order to avoid having the exercising interfere with their sleep.
It is advised to do cardio in the morning and lifting in the evening post-adaptation. 

During adaptation it's best to avoid increasing the SWS need, since it can cause an oversleep later. Because sleep deprivation hinders muscle gain, you also won't get the desired results.

Exercising can be beneficial to you during adaptation, if it's integrated into your morning routine to avoid oversleeping.

It is best to avoid raising your heart rate during dark period, so avoid cardio and intense workouts during DP.
