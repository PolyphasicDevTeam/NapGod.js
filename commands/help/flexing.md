Flexing is when you start one or more scheduled sleeps at different times than scheduled, but keeping the sleep length the same. This is strongly discouraged for beginner polysleepers (especially during adaptation), as it can prevent adaptation or even cause you to unadapt. Flexing should only be done in small increments, after being adapted for a month or two to a strict schedule. 

Nap times can be flexed as little as 15m in either direction, or as much as 2-3h either direction, which takes longer to adapt to. Always keep at least 2-3h gaps between sleeps even when flexing. Gradually increasing flex range is recommended, and it's recommended to start by flexing just one nap by 15m to be safe.
The length of a flexing adaptation takes a varying weeks that increases with difficulty of base schedule, number of sleeps flexed, range of flexing, and how much (if at all) you are flexing your core(s).

**Tricks to make flexing a schedule easier:**
> Avoid napping in peak SWS pressure of circadian rhythm (broadly 20:00-02:00).
> Avoid flexing your core(s) unless you are a experienced polysleeper, and/or are adapted to a higher TST schedule.
> Increase core lengths 30m (e.g. to 3.5h for E3 or 5h for E2).
> increase core lengths by a 90m cycle (e.g. to 4.5h for E3 or 6h for E2).
> Avoid flexing your first nap (if your schedule has more than one).
> Choose a schedule with at least 5.5h total sleep per day. (Several people have adapted to schedules with a 4.5h TST and flexed naps, such as E3 with a 3.5h core and a stable first nap.)
