If you naturaly wake prematurely (<5m on a nap, <30m on a core), get out of bed. Don't try to cram more sleep until the alarm rings. You might fall asleep and wake up in SWS, or sleep through your alarm. Falling back asleep could also be difficult and thus you'd waste time unnecessarily trying to do so.
