When choosing a polyphasic lifestyle, before attempting a schedule, please make sure you think through of the following:

**1.** Are you 18 or younger? If you are, it's still possible to be polyphasic, but it's important not to reduce sleep below 7 hours total. For more info, see `!underage`.

**2.** Do you have sleep disorders? If you have insomnia, polyphasic sleep will likely help you. If you have other severe disorders like narcolepsy, sleep apnea, or something else, consult a physician about your conditions first before becoming polyphasic. 

**3.** Do you have any physical illnesses? If you have chronic diseases like diabetes, again, consult your physician. 

**4.** Can you be polyphasic long term? Look several months ahead in your work/study schedule, and your future life. Adaptation to a sleep schedule usually takes one-two months, if you're strict. So if you only have, for example, a month and a half you shouldn't attempt polyphasic sleep at all, because you have little time to enjoy the period of success before having to switch, if you're able to adapt in that time at all. It's just not worth the effort and and reduced productivity that occurs during adaptation in such cases.
