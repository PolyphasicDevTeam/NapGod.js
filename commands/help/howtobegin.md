Now that you've got a schedule and learned other tips, how do you begin? Here are the following things to keep in mind:
**1.** You would want to fall asleep fast in your first core sleep, or first nap. If you have your core/nap earlier than your usual sleep time, try sleeping at the scheduled time anyways. If you aren't able to sleep that day you'll fall asleep easier the next day!
**2.** Prepare and make sure your alarms work! Lack of knowledge of alarm usage is recipe for adaptation failure! See `!alarms` for more information.
**3.** If you oversleep or undersleep, keep sticking to the schedule! If you consistently oversleep see `!os`.
**4.** Make sure you look through other tips (use `help` to see a full list).
