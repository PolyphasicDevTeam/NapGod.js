DUCAMAYL (Dual Core As Much As You Like)
-----------------------------------------------
*This schedule is* ***experimental*** *and* ***not well tested***, *with the specifics still being under debate and scrutiny.  It is* ***strongly recommended*** *that inexperienced polyphasers do* ***NOT*** *attempt this schedule and instead stick to something better tested (such as DC1 or DC2).*
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: The Discord Polyphasic Community
**Total sleep**: Undefined, but usually ~5.5-6.5h
**Classification**: Flexible variant in a Dual Core style
**Specification**: 2 cores, at least 1 short nap.  
**Mechanism**: Variant of SPAMAYL that includes 2 core sleeps. Evolves well from adaptation to DC1-extended, DC2-(extended) and DC3-extended then learning to flex sleep as an intermediate step. The first core sleep provides a higher percentage of SWS while the second core a higher percentage of REM. Earlier naps in the day can contain REM sleep or just light sleep to boost alertness. Requires a great sense of tiredness timing to schedule each sleep block accordingly to avoid excessive tiredness from extended wake periods. Once adapted, a core sleep can be extended by 90m occasionally. Wake gap between 2 cores can be long or short depending on days. 
**Adaptation Difficulty**: Hard
**Ideal Scheduling**: Both core sleeps around graveyard hours with some degree of flexibility (maximum flexibility is recommended to be 90m back and forth). A nap can be taken during noon break from work/school and a nap after work/school that have flexible hours. Wake gaps during the day are usually longer than at night, and fewer naps in the day are needed to sustain alertness thanks to the second core with abundant REM sleep. 1-3 daytime naps of 10-20m in length. Longer naps (e.g, 30-40m) are viable in early morning hours (6-10 AM) and if all SWS has been accounted for. Core(s) can be extended for 90m occasionally after adapted.
