If you're too sleepy, try increasing body temperature to stay awake. That includes eating protein, exercising (jumping jacks, walking, pushups, planking, etc), or focus on doing something you enjoy or excites you. You can also improve alertness by increasing blood flow to the brain via methods like eating ice chips or doing handstands.
