Intermittent fasting is acceptable for polyphasic sleep, and a ketogenic (low-carb) diet should pose no problems. Make sure to keep at least an 8-hour fasting period (no food or non-water liquids) that coincides with the dark period. 
On E2 and E3, it's best to not eat until after the first nap.
On DC schedules, it's important not to eat between the cores.
