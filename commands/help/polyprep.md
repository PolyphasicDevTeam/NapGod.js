**1.** Take some time to prepare for your schedule if possible. Quit caffeine, nicotine, drugs and excess sugar before starting. Start eating healthier and exercising. 
**2.** Begin teaching yourself to get up the moment you wake up. Start having both a night and morning routine.
**3.** Inform people around you about what you will be attempting and how this may affect both you and them. 
**4.** Start scouting out possible locations where you can nap.
**5.** Read up to understand polyphasic adaptation and what to expect. That includes other `!help` commands like `!adaptation` and `!oss`, <https://polyphasic.net/>, and asking any questions in #general_polyphasic, #beginners, or another relevant channel.
**6.** Consider shifting your current core wake time or bedtime toward your new core's bedtime or wake time if either is possible, and implement the dark period you will be following when you begin your schedule.
**7.** Install and practice using all apps you may need, like alarm apps (see `!alarms`), F.lux/Twilight/Sunsetscreen, or productivity apps.
**8.** Ensure your health and safety if you have any stress-aggravated medical conditions, like cardiovascular problems or seizures or suicidal thoughts, as you will be going through weeks of mild to severe sleep deprivation. Severity depends on the person and the schedule. See a doctor to determine if short-term sleep deprivation is an acceptable risk for you.
**9.** Create at least two huge lists:
       **1.** Tasks toward major, motivating goals that inspire your interest in more time or better sleep.
       **2.** Easy, time-consuming tasks that you can make yourself do while tired and unmotivated, like cleaning or cooking.
