Depending on how long you sleep on monophasic schedule, sleep debt can hit you hard or not at all when you are adapting to a polyphasic schedule. Generally, expect sleep debt to build and hit you around week 2 or 3 if you don't oversleep.
Eventualy the sleep debt will allow you to fall asleep instantly for your sleeps.
When enough sleep debt builds up you'll get a REM rebound, which inserts REM into the beginning of every sleep, and on schedules with a split SWS core/with low amounts of sleep you can also expect an SWS rebound to occour.
Repartitioning happens because of sleep debt if you rigidly adhere to your schedule. See `!repartition` for more information.
