Sleep cycle compression is mostly observed in dual core schedules. Segmented creates a gap between the two cores which allows both the SWS peak (typically 21:00-24:00) and REM peak (typically 06:00-09:00) to be overlapped during sleep allowing for the removal of a sleep cycle. This causes the sleep cycles to increase in length (105m). DC1 removes one REM-heavy cycle and adds one 20m nap, and the cycles compress some (100m). DC2 adds another nap, and compresses the cycles down further. (80m)

All schedules except DC1 and Segmented should first be scheduled to have 90m cycles from the start. If you start to regularly naturally wake before your alarm after the third week of adaptation, you can assume the cycles have compressed. In that case the alarms can be altered to accommodate this.
