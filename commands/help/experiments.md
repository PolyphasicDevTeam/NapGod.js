The Experiments group aims to study how different substances and activities (such as caffeine, meditation, and sugar) affect sleep with the aid of EEG sleep trackers. This improves the legitimacy of the community and helps exchange speculative claims into scientific ones. After enough data is gathered, the results will be posted on the polyphasic website. The Experiments group is looking for adapted polyphasic or monophasic sleepers with sleep trackers, people who plan on getting sleep trackers, or people who are willing to help contribute to the community by analyzing data, programming, or are otherwise just curious for what happens in the R&D side of the server. If any of these criteria fit you please tag a moderator and ask them to give you the `Experimenter` role!
