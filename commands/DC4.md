DC4 (Dual Core 4)
-----------------------------------------------
*This schedule is intended for people attempting to transition to Uberman or retain an Uberman sleep rhythm. People looking for a permanent schedule should consider DC3 or E3 instead.*
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: Tinytimrob, based on DC3 and Uberman
**Total sleep**: 4 hours 20 minutes
**Classification**: Uberman transitional schedule in a Dual Core style
**Specification**: 2 core sleeps, 4 naps
**Mechanism**: Transitional variant of DC3 with 4 naps that follows Uberman rhythm. One core sleep before midnight, one after midnight, dawn nap, mid-morning nap, mid-afternoon nap, and evening nap. Sleep stage division: First core SWS, second core mixed, naps REM.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Hard
**Ideal scheduling**: Sleeps are scheduled to start every 4 hours which resembles Uberman. Transition step to E5 or Uberman and also useful as a fallback from E5 or Uberman should adaptation fail. Generally inferior to DC3 unless keeping Uberman rhythm is useful (the extra nap leads to slower sleep onset). Cycle length on this schedule is likely to hit around 65m, so the second core might be shortenable to increase REM quantity in naps (although this is untested)
