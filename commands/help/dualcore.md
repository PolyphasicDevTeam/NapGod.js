**Dual Core schedules:**
The premise behind the Dual Core (DC) line is that splitting the night core into 2 parts to allow each core to overlap with a vital sleep peak. The first core overlaps with the SWS peak (21:00-24:00) and second core overlaps with the REM peak (06:00-09:00) to achieve the highest quality sleep. Due to the placement of the cores, the first core will contain mostly SWS, while the second will contain mostly REM.
People who often wake up during the night without being able to fall back asleep easily are often naturally Segmented, and the DC line is recommended for them.
Cycle compression is often present in the DC line (see `!compression`).
If you aren't able to sleep at these times ask in #beginners if you will be able to adapt to a DC schedule!
