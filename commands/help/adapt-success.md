**Signs to recognize when you have adapted to a schedule, in order of importance:**
**1.** Feel energized and productive when awake, no memory loss or microsleeps. Elevation in mood and good appetite.
**2.** Wake up feeling refreshed from both naps and cores. No sleep inertia.
**3.** Fall asleep quickly in all sleeps, even if you don't prepare some time beforehand to sleep. 

**The following are not necessary to be adapted, but are common in polyphasic schedule adaptations:**
**4.** Wake naturally without the need for alarms. This requires long entrainment with a sleep cycle, often months for it to be consistent.
**5.** Remember more dreams from your sleep, and have more vivid dreams. Dreams occur most often from the end of your core sleep, but it's possible to dream shortly after you fall asleep as well. (**Disclaimer:** Some people remember fewer dreams, due to consistently waking from light sleep as an adaptation to rigid sleep times.)
