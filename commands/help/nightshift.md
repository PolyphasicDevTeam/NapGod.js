For those who work night shifts, polyphasic sleep can be possible, if:
**1.** You can have a short nap at work. 
**2.** Your night shift schedule is stable everyday, for the foreseeable future.
**3.** You don't have any health problems (night shift workers tend to have higher blood pressure, heart rate, even some sleep disorders, due to destabilized circadian rhythm).

For health benefits, any form of biphasic sleep is a good choice. A good approach is to have one core sleep after work when you go home, and a small nap before you go to work. Everyman schedules are viable, but beware of their tougher adaptation process in this context.
