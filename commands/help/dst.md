DST is known as Daylight Saving Time.

DST can be hard on your schedule because altering sleep times during adaptation will confuse your body as to when it's supposed to sleep. Tiredness/grogginess during the wrong times is not uncommon. There are 2 ways to deal with DST:

**1. Rotate the schedule 1h in a single day.**
**Pros:** Fast change, works if schedule doesn't allow anything else.
**Cons:** Sets your adaptation back several days, and you'll feel groggy for a while, increasing the risk of oversleeps. This can also initiate a stage 3/4 loop that prevents adaptation entirely in some cases.

**2. Stick to the old schedule:**
**Pros:** No setback whatsoever.
**Cons:** Requires you to have a schedule that allows it shifting by an hour.

**Do not** rotate your schedule by a small increment of time over the course of a number of days, as this has been shown to destabilize your circadian rhythm more than shifting all at once.

If you're planning to start a polyphasic sleep schedule but have DST coming up soon it's wise to either go with the schedule you'll end up with in the end or wait until DST passes before switching schedules.
