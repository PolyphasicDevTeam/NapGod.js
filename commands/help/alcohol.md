Alcohol consumption leads to changes in the balance between REM and SWS, and can mess with cycle lengths. Higher consumption wrecks sleep quality and makes you feel groggy after waking. 
Moderate consumption with some time before sleep shouldn't cause issues. However, it's best avoided during adaptation completely.
