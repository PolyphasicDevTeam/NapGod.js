**First stage:**
Falling asleep and waking up are easy in each sleep (core sleep and naps) because sleep deprivation hasn't kicked in. Sleep quality is the same as in mono sleep. Sleep stages haven't compressed. Sleep cycle is still the same (typically 90m one cycle).

**Second stage:**
Tiredness is present some of the day. Waking up becomes harder as total sleep is reduced. Feeling of sleepiness becomes more apparent, and sleep debts accumulate. 

**Third stage:**
This is where the screwups begin. Sleep debts accumulate enough to often cause an oversleep. It's important to maximize your alarms to prevent this. (If and how much you oversleep depends on how much sleep you get in your schedule. The shorter it is, the more likely you are to oversleep). This is also the stage where many start to remember dreams in your nap(s)/core(s). Falling asleep becomes very hard for some sleeps, and during others falling asleep is easy, but waking up from those sleeps is much harder. Repartitioning has begun. Your sleep cycle can be reduced with the reduction of light sleep. 

**Fourth stage:**
If you bypass stage 3 (by oversleeping only minimally/not at all) you enter stage 4! There's a clear difference between stage 3 and 4, where 4 feels more like stage 2. During this stage the symptoms get progressively better. As time progresses you may start to wake naturally before your alarm from time to time, have more vivid dreams, and falling asleep won't be an issue any longer. Waking up also becomes very easy, and you start to feel alert in the day. When nap times come, sleepiness sharply rises at that moment, and when you wake up from nap, you're fresh again till the next sleep. When you meet all `!adapt-success` signs you've adapted!
