Polyphasic sleep can be understood more easily though battery charging principles. If you don't know what REM and SWS mean see `!sleepstages`. If you aren't familiar with how repartition works see `!repartition`. 

This battery-charge principle shows the relationship of how our body gets REM, SWS and our performance on polyphasic sleep:

We have *two different batteries* (REM battery and SWS battery) and they usually refill when we're asleep. These two batteries have different capacities and they recharge at different speeds. The charging circuit has to switch between them to make sure they're both decently filled because it can only charge one at a time. 
If one of the batteries is completely empty (more often REM, since it runs out faster), you don't have enough power left to wake up, or you just shut off without warning. When its very low, some stuff shuts off completely to save power (zombie mode, in which you oversleep and later wake and don't remember anything) or it intermittently shuts off for small periods of time to try and slow down the battery drain (see `!microsleep`).

 When the battery is just low, but not very low, you feel sleep deprived (like when you get the red power indicator light, or that annoying "your battery is running low" popup warning). When the battery is medium or higher you feel okay (green light, no warnings). Like a normal battery it takes way way more time to get from empty to full than it takes to get from empty to medium. The SWS battery doesn't usualy drain fully on schedules with >5h of sleep.

The **objective on polysleep** is to set up the charging routine and battery level in such a way that you're batteries are full and get filled the instant they're drained (because of rebounds).
