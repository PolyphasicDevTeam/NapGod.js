**Cold turkey:**
Jump straight from monosleep into your desired schedule.

**Naptation:**
Stay awake for around 36h then start napping for 20m (adapting to nap-only schedules like Uberman), to practice napping.

**Gradual adaptation:**
Start with easy schedules, then move to harder ones by cutting down total sleep after each adaptation.
