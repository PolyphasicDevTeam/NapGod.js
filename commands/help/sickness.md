When you're sick with anything more than a mild flu (with symptoms above the neck), it's best to return to mono to fully recover before continue polyphasic sleep. If you are adapted to a poly schedule and get sick, you can still be polyphasic, but lengthen your core sleep(s) and nap(s) to extend recovery. During sleep deprivation of polyphasic sleep, it will be harder for your immune system to resist sickness.
Try boosting your immune system before trying to adapt again. Make sure you're eating healthily, exercising and so on!

Naps should be replaced by an extra full cycle; do not use a random length.
