Microsleeping occurs when the body is so sleep deprived that it forcibly shuts itself down for a few seconds, up to a minute or two (any longer is called a crash) in order to regain some vital sleeps. It's essentially your body's way of saying "if you won't sleep enough, I'll force you to!".

Microsleeps are generally preceeded by an alertness dip, and often occur in cycles of 2-5 microsleeps in a row. It's best to stand up and move around (see `!stayawake`) to prevent getting caught in microsleep cycles and then subsequently crashing.

Microsleeps can be difficult to avoid, but it's imperative that you limit them as much as possible for the following reasons

**1.** If you have consistent microsleeps every day, they can become repartitioned into your sleep schedule, causing you to microsleep at the same time every day. 

**2.** The more you microsleep on a daily basis, the more likely you are to continue doing so in subsequent days, which may lead to crashes (oversleeps).

**3.** If you microsleep an extreme amount, it can even delay your adaptation by preventing you from achieving high enough levels of sleep deprivation to begin the repartitioning process.
