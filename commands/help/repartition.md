After successfully adaptating to a polyphasic schedule, sleep stage repartition is complete. Repartition means the rearrangement of vital sleep stages into each sleep (core/nap) in your schedule. This results in situations where a sleeper may have a nap full of SWS in the evening, and a nap full of REM around dawn. 

**Before repartitioning**: When one first begins polyphasic sleep, sleep stages have not been repartitioned. The process of falling asleep goes like this: Sleeper enters NREM1 (Non-REM; light sleep), with wakeful state for some time, then NREM2, starting to fall asleep and reality of surrounding fades and awareness gradually becomes null, NREM3 (or SWS, Slow-Wave Sleep), the deepest sleep stage, and finally REM (Rapid Eye Movement), where dreams occur. This process applies to monophasic sleepers as well.

**After repartitioning**: Once adaptation is complete, your sleep schedule is stabilized in most sleeps. It's common to expect a very dreamy nap around dawn, suggesting that the nap is REM dominant. You will obviously go through NREM1 and NREM2 (takes some time to fall asleep), but you bypass NREM3 to enter REM. Since adaptation is successful, you wake up easily and after around 15m of REM (this number is just an example), you will likely enter NREM1 and wake up comfortably. If you nap late in the day, results vary - you might enter REM very quickly after lying down, or it could be an SWS dominant nap, in which you won't recall dreams and you'll sleep very deeply. You may also get both SWS and REM in just a 20m nap. 

**Conclusively**, after repartitioning is complete, NREM1 and NREM2 are reduced in your sleeps, saving space for SWS and REM which are more important for physical and mental functions.
