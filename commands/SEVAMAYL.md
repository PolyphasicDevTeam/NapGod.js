SEVAMAYL (Sleep EVeryman As Much As You Like)
-----------------------------------------------
*This schedule is* ***experimental*** *and* ***not well tested***, *with the specifics still being under debate and scrutiny.  It is* ***strongly recommended*** *that inexperienced polyphasers do* ***NOT*** *attempt this schedule and instead stick to something better tested (such as E2 or E3).*
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: aethermind
**Total sleep**: Undefined, but may average around 5-5.5 hours
**Classification**: Flexi schedule in an Everyman style
**Specification**: 1 core, multiple short naps
**Mechanism**: Variant of SPAMAYL that includes a core sleep. Evolves well from adaptation to E3-extended, then E3- extended-flex as a helpful intermediate. The core sleep provides SWS and some REM, with naps providing the remaining REM. Strong reliance on the ability to detect when the need to rest is, to get quality REM naps.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Variable
**Ideal scheduling**: Around a 4-4.5 hour core (3 x 80-90 mins) with about 2-6 naps of 10-20 minutes in length. Favor natural wakes. Cycles may naturally compress to 80m with frequent sleeps, like E3; plan for 90m cycles until there are many early natural wakes. Nap spacing should take into account natural periods of tiredness. In the evening 6 hour gaps are common,  whereas alertness may wane after 3-4 hours awake in the morning. Some longer pronaps of <45m might be plausible during REM peak (6-9am) if all SWS has already been accounted for. The core might be flexed and/or varied max 90m in length, as optional variables after adapted to a base schedule.
