NS stands for "Newcomer Syndrome", which often occurs in new polyphasic sleepers, who decide to the hardest sleep schedules like Uberman, Tesla, and Dymaxion knowing that they DON'T have the short sleeper genes that would allow them to sleep less in the day without feeling tired. (If you have this gene, you would have known by the time you became an adult). This syndrome is severe because it cultivates the misconception that everyone can sleep as little as 2 hours per day while gaining superhuman productivity. (You most likely can not.)

The adaptation to these hostile schedules is extremely severe, and sticking with them long term can cause severe physical/mental exhaustion due to the extreme lack of amount of vital sleep stages that are normally present.

If you're a newcomer, please be realistic in choosing a suitable sleep schedule for yourself, and take your time to consider what's best for your own well-being.
Try to sleep for more than 4h a day if you're over 21. If you're between 18 and 21 you should get at least 5h of sleep, and if you're underage, see `!underage`.
