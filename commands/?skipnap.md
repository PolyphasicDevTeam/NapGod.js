During adaptation (first month), it's best to follow your schedule strictly, and avoid oversleeping and skipping nap or changing your sleep schedule around continuously.
If you're going to miss sleep it's best to skip rather than to move, since moving counts as an oversleep (any sleep outside of schedule), which sets you back.

Losing a nap means you'll increase the risk of an oversleep later, so be sure you're prepared for this. Set up extra alarms or ask someone to check on you to make sure you're awake.

Move your sleeps only if you know not doing so will result in an even bigger oversleep later. Make sure it's not too close to the next nap/core sleep (spare around 4h before the next core sleep, if your nap is 30m or below).

If you have to skip some parts of your core do it in chunks of 90m (full cycles) to avoid waking up in the middle of them (increased SWS wake risk). If you have to skip your whole core try to at least get some naps in during that time.
